\title{Compute and Store Distance Matrix}
\usage{
scca_compute_dist(m, filename = NULL, method = "euclidian")
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{A matrix containing the bi-partite network}

\item{filename}{Name of the file (string) in which to store the distance matrix. If NULL (default) the
distance will not be stored, but only returned}

\item{method}{See: \code{\link[stats]{dist}}}
}
\value{
The distance matrix as an \emph{dist} object
}
\description{
This function is a wrapper around \link[stats]{dist}.
Some validity and stability tests use a distance (or dissimilarity) matrix to calculate their measures (e.g. Dunn Index).
Calculating a distance matrix can take a long time (up to hours) depending on the number of observations (rows).
This function has the option to store the distance matrix in a .rds file for repeated used.
