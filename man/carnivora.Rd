\description{
This common-used dataset in Ecology, gives the geographical distributions of the mammalian order Carnivora.
The data set is comprised by an incidence matrix M
(i.e. presence-absence matrix), with 41,580 non-empty sites (rows) and 288 extant terrestrial and marine species (columns).
The sites represent grid-cells rasterised at a resolution of 0.78 latitudinal degrees.
The distributional data results from rasterizing range map distributions published as part of
the Phylacine v1.2 dataset \strong{Faurby 2019}, which includes
data on the geographic distributions of mammals both extant and extinct over the last 130,000 years.
The data was downloaded (last accessed on November 2019) and pruned
to only include carnivores.
Data was processed in R (R Core Development Team 2014) and mapped in QGIS v2.18.16 (QGIS Development Team 2015).
